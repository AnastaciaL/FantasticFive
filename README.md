Correlation between wineries, prices and scores
Questions:
1. 	What are the wineries with the highest average wine score?
2. 	What are the wineries with the most expensive wines on average?
3. 	What is a correlation between a price and a score of a wine?

Q 1. What are the wineries with the highest average wine score?
The wineries with the highest average wine score are:
•	Domaine Zind-Humbrecht (France)
•	Lynmar (USA, California)
•	Williams Selyem (USA, California)
•	Louis Jadot (France)
•	Foxen (California)
Shortcomings:
1.	It’s not specified whenever people who rated wines were wine experts or regular wine drinkers. There could be a difference between the ratings of experts and non-experts due to an acquired taste or simply due to an innate ability. Regular drinkers tend to like more sweet wines.

2.	 As it was previously determined that US wines received the highest number of reviews, it could be explained by the cultural habits, as it’s very common to rate your experience in US.

Since we don’t know the country location of reviewers we could only speculate that most of the ratings were given by American people, and they could rank French wines higher as it’s more exotic for them.

3.	It is not clear if reviewers were affected by knowledge of wine price. Marketing provides one channel through which consumers can be influenced to buy certain wines. Also wine critics may also play a role in affecting wine prices and shaping consumer preferences. So regular wine drinkers could subconsciously rank more expensive wines or more “popular wines” higher.

Q 2. What are the wineries with the most expensive wines on average?
Top 5 wineries with the highest average wine price are:
•	Louis Latour (France)
•	Louis Jabot (France)
•	Albert Bichot (France)
•	Chanson Pere et Fils (France)
•	Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter (France)

And, surprisingly, they all are located in France.
What contributes to higher price? The price of a bottle of wine reflects a few things: the raw materials of grapes, barrels and bottles, plus utilities and labor. Secondly, expensive wines are expensive because they can be, because of existing phenomenon known as “perceived value,” in which how much a consumer is willing to pay affects the price of a good or service.

Q 3. What is the correlation between a price and a score of a wine?
While there is a clear trend: the higher an average price the higher a rating of a wine, it could be explained by subjective appreciation, it means people tend to rank higher more expensive wines. As the pleasure people get from consuming wine depends both on its intrinsic qualities such as taste and smell and external attributes such as price and presentation.
